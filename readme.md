# One AiQ: Odoo Challenge

## Before starting
Before starting I researched about Odoo to have a better understanding about what it is, how it works and went thru the development guide. 

For that I used the following references: 
- General Odoo Development Overview
https://medium.com/@jivasotechnologies/mastering-odoo-development-a-comprehensive-guide-a51ac2584457

- Basic understanding odoo interface (first module):
https://www.odoo.com/slides/getting-started-15

- Official development documentation
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/tutorials.html
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/administration/odoo_sh/getting_started/first_module.html?highlight=libraries

- Official Python documentation
https://docs.python.org/3/

### Task 1: Working Odoo Instance
I found the following repository https://github.com/minhng92/odoo-17-docker-compose with the Docker Composer and used it to spin up the containers for PostgreSQL and Odoo 17. In the docker composer Odoo service I have adjusted the Oddo port for the requested one (8069) and runned the following command to spin up the containers:

`docker-compose up -d`

###### Odoo URL
http://localhost:8069

###### Restart Odoo:
`docker-compose restart`

###### Stop Odoo:
`docker-compose down`

###### Additional Information:
- Logs file: ./etc/odoo-server.log
- Config file: ./etc/odoo.conf
- Custom Addons folder: ./addons


# Task 2 

Create the view layer
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/th/developer/reference/user_interface/view_records.html?highlight=view#odoo.addons.base.models.ir_ui_view.View

I have researched about Odoo constrains, depends and exceptions

# Task 3: 
Testing on Odoo Research

Configuration changes to enable tests on odoo.conf

# Bonus 1: Add custom discount button

- A new button called "Apply Custom Discount" was added at the view layer
- Business logic was updated: if a custom discount is applied, it overrides the default 10% low stock discount
- During my research I found that there is an especific action type button. Howevwer, I wasn't able to successfully implement it. I will need to research futher how to properly use it. 
- The current implementation prioritizes functionality while maintaining compatibility with existing components.

#### Limitations 
While working on this challenge, I faced some dificulties:
- I was unable to run the tests inside the container environment, which prevented me from properly validating them. 

- VS Code was unable to correctly recognize Odooâ€™s libraries, making development and debugging more difficult.

- These issues highlighted the need for deeper research on how to configure a pratical development environment for Odoo, particulary container integration and IDE support.
